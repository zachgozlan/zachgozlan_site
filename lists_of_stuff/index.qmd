title: "Lists of Stuff"
---

Data starts at the home. I maintain a number of documents that are basically journals of stuff I have done or seen. Some of this may one day become a data project, some of this is merely because life is a very long time and it's nice to have a comprehensive record of these things for future reference.

### Show Log

Since the start of 2008, I've maintained a text document of every band I've ever seen live. Because to collect something is to seek it out, I've been to a lot of shows over the years. At least 20% of my motivation for building this site is to get this somewhere online at last. Anyway, it's available [here.](../showlog/index.qmd)

### Sports Lists

I've kept track of several different aspects of sporting events I've attended.

#### Games Attended

This is essentially the same as the concert list, but sports. It is available [here.](../sportslog/index.qmd) I also maintain a profile on the app [AC Momento](https://www.acmomento.com/), if you'd like to look me up on there.

#### Baseball

You must understand by now that I am someone who simply must know which players I have seen the most in my baseball-attending career. As I've now been going to games for a pretty long time, it's always satisfying to realize I had actually seen this random relief pitcher a decade ago on another team. There's probably no need to publish the full list, but here's my top ten most-seen players (plus ties) as of the end of the 2024 season:

| Batter           | PA  | AB  | R   | H   | BA    | RBI | BB  | SO  | 2B  | 3B  | HR  | SB  | HBP | Games | Team(s)  |

| Starling Marte   | 28  | 25  | 5   | 8   | 0.32  | 0   | 2   | 5   |     |     |     | 6   | 1   | 6     | PIT, NYM |
| David Wright     | 28  | 24  | 4   | 6   | 0.25  | 5   | 2   | 5   | 2   |     | 3   |     | 2   | 7     | NYM      |

There's a pitcher-focused list as well, but it's not nearly as interesting; I don't go to enough games to have seen any starter in my life more like two or three times. But because I have the numbers, it's worth sharing that as of the end of the 2024 season I have seen **501** distinct hitters and **239** distinct pitchers.

Go Mets.

#### Basketball

Baseball is a game where counting stats accumulate slowly, and an amazing night (say, four hits) isn't that much bigger of a number than a good game (two hits) or a bad one (no hits). Basketball - especially the NBA - is much more prone to stars having big, memorable nights and putting up gaudy numbers. With that in mind, I also track individual performances I've witnessed in person with the NBA (and college ball), but what I care most about is the best individual night I've ever seen. Here are the ten best NBA performances I've ever seen:

### Running Mileage

### Places I've Been

The above list of lists is not exhaustive! There are plenty of other personal-documentation things I do or have done that just don't need to be public. Here's a screen from an interactive Google Map I maintain of everywhere I've spend the night:
