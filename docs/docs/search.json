    "text": "Thank you for “hanging ten” to “surf the web” over to my personal website! Those are slang terms - I am not into surfing. (I apologize if there was any confusion. There will be no further jokes.) I am a data guy who lives in Washington, DC. This site is intended to be both an organized place to show off my miscellaneous data projects I’ve put together over the past few years and a few additional bits and pieces that I wanted to get into one place.\nSince 2020, I have worked for the Universal Service Administrative Company on their Data Strategy team.1 Prior to USAC, I was part of the first cohort of students to complete the Master’s in Data Science for Public Policy at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. That degree is on my wall next to an undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh, to which I pledge my undying loyalty.\nYou’ll get a pretty good sense of what I do outside of work by browsing the site, but the short answer is a lot of trivia-related stuff, some running, and being a sports watcher guy. I’m also very precious about my music tastes - here’s what I’ve been listening to lately, if you’re curious."

In the months prior to my appearance, I used study methods developed by previous contestants to build a data project out of studying for the show. This included identifying the patterns seen on Jeopardy! game boards to determine the most important subjects for me to study, as well as using text analysis methods to quickly identify the most important facts to know about a given topic.\n\nAn article I wrote about the project, including methods and outcomes, is available here.\nA presentation I gave at my office’s internal “Data Day” is also available for viewing here. I am aware that I should have used the provided microphone.\nMy git repo for this project is available here.\n\nWhile I did not win on the episode of Jeopardy! discussed in the project, I did nonetheless get to return two years later to compete on Pop Culture Jeopardy! - which is currently available for streaming on Prime Video - and that went better for me.\n\n\nLearnedLeague Season Simulator\nLearnedLeague is an online trivia competition that dorks like me do for daily hits of validation. After previously writing a less complicated script to predict fantasy sports match-ups (discussed below), I expanded that code to create a Monte Carlo simulation of LearnedLeague seasons.\nTo view the git repo for this project, click here."

    "text": "Professional Wrestling Projects\nI am probably one of very few practitioners in the field of professional wrestling data analysis. That may be because that is a field with absolutely no potential value to anyone above it being kind of interesting to a small number of people. But that also means I might be the best at it. Think about that.\n\nAEW Wrestler TrueSkill Dashboard Project\nDuring the first few years of its existence, professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) published a ranking system within the fiction of professional wrestling to select top contenders for its various titles. As a personal challenge, I devoted several weeks in 2021 to creating an objective alternative to this ranking. This ultimately produced a ranking based in the TrueSkill package and a Tableau dashboard that allowed users to see the rankings on any given day since the company’s start in 2019.\n\nThe final dashboard product is available on Tableau Public here. It is no longer being updated as of January 2024.\nA somewhat longer narrative write-up of this project is available here.\nAfter I realized the ratings provided by the model had some amount of predictive ability, I wrote about that in the context of a particularly lopsided match in a Reddit post available here. The post was later nominated for best submission of the year by the community, receiving 8% of the vote and finishing in sixth.\nThe full git repo is available here.\n\n\n\nNXT TakeOver Wrestler Network\nAs practice in the field of network analysis, I pulled the complete set of matches that happened at NXT TakeOver events and created a network of all wrestlers who have either competed against one another or teamed together, as well as running some basic centrality measures on that network. The git repo for that project is available here."

This led to me building a Flask application on the Python Anywhere platform, which I used to run a Calcutta auction for the 2023 March Madness tournament. The final product ran relatively slowly, but as a first effort I am proud of it. I lost money on this endeavor, which is probably for the best.\n\nThe app itself, which is probably still live as you reading this, is available here.\nThe (incomplete) git repo for the project is available here.\n\n\n\nFantasy League Monte Carlo Simulation\nThis is the original attempt at writing a script that simulates a series of head-to-head matchups, factoring in previous records and tiebreakers to predict a likelihood that any given team finishes in any given place in the standings table. I’ve iterated over it plenty of times as I’ve gotten better at Python and as Yahoo! continuously changes its interface, but the git repo for a reasonably recent version is available here."

Conveniently, I was invited to two weddings that summer and decided to make that their problems. Because I had robust Facebook Messenger chat histories with parts of both of the two weddings, I decided it’d be neat to pull down those chat logs and do something with them.\nAt one wedding, I was the man of honor (although I used “maid of honor” plenty, because that was a fun thing to get to call myself) and as part of that role gave a speech during the reception. In a portion of the speech, I surprised the bride with a series of metrics regarding how many times we had mentioned our respective dogs, a playlist of every YouTube video we had sent each other in the past ten years, and the first times she had mentioned her now husband in our chat, among other milestones. It is worth mentioning that this was not the entire speech, and also that despite the relative simplicity of “download and analyze a json” this is probably the most satisfied I have been with any project I have ever done.\nAt the other wedding, I was involved in a robust group chat with one of parties getting married; including with an actual gift was a ten-page long “card” detailing various group chat inside jokes and a term-frequency analysis of words that each member used the most since we had started talking.\nAs you can imagine, both of these end products are personal and won’t be shared. The git repo, of course, is available here."

Some of this may one day become a data project, some of this is merely because life is a very long time and it’s nice to have a comprehensive record of these things for future reference.\n\nShow Log\nSince the start of 2008, I’ve maintained a text document of every band I’ve ever seen live. Because to collect something is to seek it out, I’ve been to a lot of shows over the years. At least 20% of my motivation for building this site is to get this somewhere online at last. Anyway, it’s available here.\n\n\nSports Lists\nI’ve kept track of several different aspects of sporting events I’ve attended.\n\nGames Attended\nThis is essentially the same as the concert list, but sports. It is available here. I also maintain a profile on the app AC Momento, if you’d like to look me up on there.\n\n\nBaseball\nYou must understand by now that I am someone who simply must know which players I have seen the most in my baseball-attending career. As I’ve now been going to games for a pretty long time, it’s always satisfying to realize I had actually seen this random relief pitcher a decade ago on another team. There’s probably no need to publish the full list, but here’s my top ten most-seen players (plus ties) through the games listed on the “games attended” page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatter\nPA\nAB\nR\nH\nBA\nRBI\nBB\nSO\n2B\n3B\nHR\nSB\nHBP\nGames\nTeam(s)\n\n\n\n\nJuan Soto\n46\n41\n4\n8\n0.195\n7\n5\n12\n2\n\n2\n\n\n11\nWSN, NYM\n\n\nBrandon Nimmo\n42\n35\n10\n12\n0.343\n11\n7\n5\n5\n\n2\n\n\n9\nNYM\n\n\nLuis García Jr.\n41\n39\n3\n9\n0.231\n0\n2\n7\n3\n\n\n1\n\n10\nWSN\n\n\nPete Alonso\n41\n38\n7\n8\n0.211\n7\n3\n13\n\n1\n1\n\n\n9\nNYM\n\n\nFrancisco Lindor\n38\n30\n6\n9\n0.3\n7\n5\n3\n1\n\n3\n2\n3\n8\nCLE, NYM\n\n\nAndrew McCutchen\n37\n30\n4\n4\n0.133\n2\n6\n3\n\n\n1\n3\n\n8\nPIT, MIL\n\n\nLane Thomas\n34\n30\n7\n9\n0.3\n3\n4\n6\n1\n\n2\n5\n\n8\nWSN\n\n\nRyan Zimmerman\n32\n29\n3\n5\n0.172\n4\n3\n9\n2\n\n\n\n\n8\nWSN\n\n\nStarling Marte\n32\n28\n6\n9\n0.321\n1\n3\n6\n\n\n1\n6\n1\n7\nPIT, NYM\n\n\nPedro Álvarez\n32\n28\n3\n6\n0.214\n7\n4\n9\n3\n\n2\n\n\n8\nPIT\n\n\n\nThere’s a pitcher-focused list as well, but it’s not nearly as interesting; I don’t go to enough games to have seen any starter in my life more like two or three times. But because I have the numbers, I know that I have seen 556 distinct hitters and 275 distinct pitchers.\nGo Mets.\n\n\nBasketball\nBaseball is a game where counting stats accumulate slowly, and an amazing night (say, four hits) isn’t that much bigger of a number than a good game (two hits) or a bad one (no hits). Basketball - especially the NBA - is much more prone to stars having big, memorable nights and putting up gaudy numbers. With that in mind, I also track individual performances I’ve witnessed in person with the NBA (and college ball), but what I care most about is the best individual night I’ve ever seen, as determined by Game Score. Here are the ten best NBA performances I’ve ever seen out of 530 total player appearances, through the games listed on my “games attended” page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nGame\nPlayer\nMinutes\nFG\nFGA\n3P\n3PA\nFT\nFTA\nTRB\nAST\nSTL\nBLK\nTOV\nPF\nPTS\nGame Score\n\n\n\n\n10/30/2019\nHOU@WAS\nJames Harden\n37:30\n18\n32\n6\n14\n17\n18\n3\n9\n1\n0\n4\n3\n59\n46.8\n\n\n10/30/2019\nHOU@WAS\nBradley Beal\n40:30\n14\n20\n7\n12\n11\n12\n6\n8\n3\n0\n5\n4\n46\n41.8\n\n\n3/23/2023\nDEN@WAS\nNikola Jokić\n33:36\n12\n16\n2\n3\n5\n5\n12\n7\n3\n0\n2\n1\n31\n35.7\n\n\n10/30/2016\nLAL@OKC\nRussell Westbrook\n33:39\n11\n21\n5\n6\n6\n6\n12\n16\n1\n1\n7\n3\n33\n33.0\n\n\n12/20/2017\nUTA@OKC\nRussell Westbrook\n27:29\n10\n13\n0\n0\n4\n4\n10\n7\n4\n0\n1\n2\n24\n30.6\n\n\n4/3/2025\nORL@WAS\nBub Carrington\n36:38\n12\n18\n7\n10\n1\n1\n9\n7\n0\n0\n1\n3\n32\n30.0\n\n\n3/8/2015\nTOR@OKC\nRussell Westbrook\n40:06\n9\n21\n1\n4\n11\n13\n11\n17\n4\n1\n9\n1\n30\n29.8\n\n\n1/8/2024\nOKC@WAS\nChet Holmgren\n31:47\n11\n14\n4\n5\n5\n8\n4\n5\n0\n2\n0\n3\n31\n29.7\n\n\n2/26/2017\nNOP@OKC\nRussell Westbrook\n36:53\n14\n29\n2\n8\n11\n12\n11\n11\n1\n0\n9\n2\n41\n28.9\n\n\n2/26/2017\nNOP@OKC\nAnthony Davis\n32:13\n15\n28\n2\n3\n6\n6\n7\n4\n1\n0\n1\n4\n38\n28.9\n\n\n\nLiving in Oklahoma City during the “now I do what I want” Brodie era sure was swell.
