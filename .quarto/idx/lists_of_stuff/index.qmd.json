As I've now been going to games for a pretty long time, it's always satisfying to realize I had actually seen this random relief pitcher a decade ago on another team. There's probably no need to publish the full list, but here's my top ten most-seen players (plus ties) through the games listed on the \"games attended\" page:\n\n| Batter           | PA  | AB  | R   | H   | BA    | RBI | BB  | SO  | 2B  | 3B  | HR  | SB  | HBP | Games | Team(s)  |\n|:-----------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:------|:---------|\n| Juan Soto        | 46  | 41  | 4   | 8   | 0.195 | 7   | 5   | 12  | 2   |     | 2   |     |     | 11    | WSN, NYM |\n| Brandon Nimmo    | 42  | 35  | 10  | 12  | 0.343 | 11  | 7   | 5   | 5   |     | 2   |     |     | 9     | NYM      |\n| Luis García Jr.  | 41  | 39  | 3   | 9   | 0.231 | 0   | 2   | 7   | 3   |     |     | 1   |     | 10    | WSN      |\n| Pete Alonso      | 41  | 38  | 7   | 8   | 0.211 | 7   | 3   | 13  |     | 1   | 1   |     |     | 9     | NYM      |\n| Francisco Lindor | 38  | 30  | 6   | 9   | 0.3   | 7   | 5   | 3   | 1   |     | 3   | 2   | 3   | 8     | CLE, NYM |\n| Andrew McCutchen | 37  | 30  | 4   | 4   | 0.133 | 2   | 6   | 3   |     |     | 1   | 3   |     | 8     | PIT, MIL |\n| Lane Thomas      | 34  | 30  | 7   | 9   | 0.3   | 3   | 4   | 6   | 1   |     | 2   | 5   |     | 8     | WSN      |\n| Ryan Zimmerman   | 32  | 29  | 3   | 5   | 0.172 | 4   | 3   | 9   | 2   |     |     |     |     | 8     | WSN      |\n| Starling Marte   | 32  | 28  | 6   | 9   | 0.321 | 1   | 3   | 6   |     |     | 1   | 6   | 1   | 7     | PIT, NYM |\n| Pedro Álvarez    | 32  | 28  | 3   | 6   | 0.214 | 7   | 4   | 9   | 3   |     | 2   |     |     | 8     | PIT      |\n\nThere's a pitcher-focused list as well, but it's not nearly as interesting; I don't go to enough games to have seen any starter in my life more like two or three times.

Basketball - especially the NBA - is much more prone to stars having big, memorable nights and putting up gaudy numbers. With that in mind, I also track individual performances I've witnessed in person with the NBA (and college ball), but what I care most about is the best individual night I've ever seen, as determined by [Game Score](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/game-score/).
