Since 2020, I have worked for the [Universal Service Administrative Company](https://www.usac.org/) on their Data Strategy team.\n\nPrior to USAC, I was part of the first cohort of students to complete the [Master's in Data Science for Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science-for-public-policy/) at GeorgetownÂ University's McCourt School of Public Policy. That degree is on my wall next to an undergrad degree from the University of Pittsburgh, to which I pledge undying loyalty.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
