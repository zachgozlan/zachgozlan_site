**Clue Category:** *Geographic Neighbors*

**Clue Text:** The "Hermit Nation" & the "Land of the Morning Calm" are nicknames for these 2 neighbors.

**Answer:** North Korea, South Korea

The only clue that used "Hermit" for North Korea used "Hermit Kingdom" instead, also the only instance of that term in the archive. "Morning" and "calm" similarly has one result prior to this one. "Hermit" is maybe in retrospect the obvious hint here; the data points to that being used more for "Peter the" and Herbert Hoover ("the Hermit Author of Palo Alto").

**Grade:** B
